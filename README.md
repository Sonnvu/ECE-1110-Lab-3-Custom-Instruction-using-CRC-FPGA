# ECE-1110 Lab-3: Custom Instruction using CRC FPGA
ECE 1110 Computer Organization and Architecture Lab 3
In this lab, we are implementing vector add example design on Xilinx Alveo U250 with frequency of 300MHz. In addition to the design in lab 2, we also expand the computation range to subtraction, multiplication and division. With more resource required, we observe the change in LUT, REG, BRAM, URAM and DSP as well as the GOPS. Using Vivado, we also can observe the increase of hardware power in the acceleration card.
